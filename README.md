# RealEstateDatabase
Final project for CMIS 242 Intermediate Java Programming class.

This project focused on using a TreeMap as a runtime database of property objects. The objects implemented a StateChangeable interface which accepted an emum as an argument. For this implementation, the interface StateChangeable accepted an enum of Status when implemented by the class Property which included the status a property in the datbase might use (e.g. FOR_SALE, UNDER_CONTRACT, SOLD). 

This project taught me the importance of planning a project to be as modular as possible.

Key concepts applied:
* Object Oriented Programming
* enum
* programming to an interface
* abstraction
* Genarics
* Exception Handling

Fun project to wrap up this class.
